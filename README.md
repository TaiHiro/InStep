As of the midterm, this website has the following features:
* Media queries for responsive design
* A working menu dropdown
* Hover effects for text
* Hover effects for images
* Working links for scrolling between sections

As of the final, this website has the following features:
* Better responsive design overall (less ugly)
* A new models section, featuring:
    * a carousel
    * hover effects for the models
    * auto rotation + dragging capability
    * zoom in/out


Things to continue doing:
* Add subpages with more information about each prototype and each model
* Update main image to newest iteration of the cane
* Tooltip or modal on hover/click on each model? Might be too difficult to integrate with three.js
